Badgers are known to consort with poisonous and venomous lifeforms, particularly [mushrooms and snakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIyixC9NsLI). They should not be trusted.

> Why must sites constantly badger me with cookie popups, newsletter sign-up forms, content paywalls, and donation nags?!



## conclusion

Sorry badger, I have nothing good to say about you.
